config CARRIER
    int "Carrier to use"
    default 0
    help
        The availability of the channels and the exact regulation to use them varies in different countries.
		See ETSI TS 103 636-2 5.4.2 for the calculation.

config NETWORK_ID
	int "Network ID"
	range 1 4294967295
	default 91

config TX_POWER
	int "TX power"
	range 0 13
	default 13
	help
	   	Transmission power, see table 6.2.1-3 of ETSI TS 103 636-4.

config TX_POWER_MARGIN_DBM
	int "TX power margin in dBm"
	range -128 127
	default 3
	help
		Transmission power margin in dBm. This value is added to the transmission power in dBm while computing the power requiered for communication. 

config RSSI_TARGET
	int "RSSI target"
	range -128 0
	default -80
	help
	   	Target RSSI value for the connection.
	   	By reducing this value, the transmission power will reduce at the price of a reduced range and a poorer signal quality.

config HARQ_RX_EXPIRY_TIME_US
	int "HARQ RX expiry time in microseconds"
	range 0 5000000
	default 1000000
	help
		A HARQ process soft buffer allocation is released when there have been no receptions to that buffer within the buffer's expiry time.

config HARQ_MAX_TRANSMISSIONS
	int "HARQ max transmissions"
	range 1 255
	default 5
	help
		Maximum number of transmissions for a HARQ transmission. If this number is reached, the HARQ transimsson is considered failed.
		(initial transmission + n retransmission) i.e. 5 means 1 initial transmission and 4 retransmissions.

config HARQ_RX_WAITING_TIME_MS
	int "HARQ RX waiting time in milliseconds"
	range 0 10000
	default 25
	help
		Waiting time in ms before consedering the transmission has not reached the target. After this time, a retransmission is triggered.

config HARQ_PROCESS_COUNT
	int "HARQ process count"
	range 1 8
	default 4
	help
		Number of HARQ processes to use. can be 1, 2, 4 or 8. the buffer memory is divided by this number. so the more processes, the less memory per process.
