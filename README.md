_insert logos of "DECT NR+", "Nordic semi", "HEVS"_

## About The Project
This project is undertaken as part of Simon Donnet-Monay's bachelor's thesis in collaboration with **HES-SO Valais/Wallis** and **Nordic Semiconductor** 

## Description
This repository contains an implementation of a part of the MAC layer. The implemented part is the HARQ protocol. The HARQ protocol is the protocol that handle the acknowledgement and retransmission of messages sent. 

This can be used as an example of how to implement the HARQ protocol and also shows a way to use the [DECT NR+ PHY API](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrfxlib/nrf_modem/doc/api.html#dect_nr_phy_api).
